Change Log
==========

Unreleased
----------

  Fork of the oraschemadoc project::

    Added writer and formatter packages to begin abstracting how objects are
    written out.

    Fixed bugs which stopped the original package from working

    Fixed processing of databases with USASCII7 encoding.  If this was the
    encoding set for a database, the doc gen would fail.

    Add reST output support, so that we can abstract the look/feel and overal
    doc layout from this package.  The end goal is to generate "generic" docs
    for that database that can be incorporated into whatever doc process one
    has.  To start, that focus is on reST and Sphinx.
